      <description>Recently I had the chance to give a talk at the Razorpay office as a part of FOSS United Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s meetup. This was a full length talk and I had a great time talking to like minded people about this.
This itself is a pretty niche topic, but a lot of people aren&amp;rsquo;t really aware of the system-d feud, so I decided why not give a talk on it? The material I used for the talk is below.</description>

      <description>Setup A CRUD API or a Create-Read-Update-Delete API is one of the first steps you take in your journey exploring the world of backend development.
Get started with Golang by installing it on your computer if you havenâ€™t already done so.
This tutorial will require some basic knowledge of golang.
Next we will install the packages needed for creating the CRUD API. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Gin Gonic to route the API endpoints.</description>

      <description>(This was originally published here, check out PESU-ECC&amp;rsquo;s MUNSOC site and show them some love!)
Iran Contra Affair The sale of arms to Iran, hostage exchanges(supposed), hezbollah and the civil war in Nicaragua. How are all these related? Well its a long story.
In simple terms; during the second Reagan term, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sales of weapons to Iran which at the time was under an arms embargo, and diverted the profits to the Contras, a group of anti-socialist rebels in Nicaragua that were opposed to the socialist Sandinista led government.</description>
