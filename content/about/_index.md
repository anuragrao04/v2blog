### Hello there!

Hey, I'm Siddharth! I'm a second year student at PES University. I'm an aspiring computer science egnineer
and I have an interest in the networks and systems side of things. I'm passionate about Linux, open source and I mostly
code in Go.

This is my personal blog where I post about pretty much all the stuff I find cool.
